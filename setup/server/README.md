# Overview

This directory contains some scripts to simplify the setup and deployment of Webble World
on one or more Ubuntu 16.04 (systemd) servers.

The scripts assume that Webble World is used for production or testing deployments and thus 
requires the manual setup of secrets (via environment variables) and a few configuration values.

The recommended setup for deploying production or testing deployments of Webble World is to use
one Ubuntu server as the "gateway"
