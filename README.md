Webbles are interactive digital objects that resides inside
Webble World which is a new web-based knowledge media
architecture, available through an Internet browser, that
allows us, not only to publish compound documents with or
without embedded services and tools into a world-wide shared
repository like the Web, but also to reedit any compound
documents available from such a shared repository, through
direct manipulations, and through composition of new compound
documents for local reuse and for publication to the shared
repository. The reediting of compound documents denotes the
extraction and recombination of their visual portions to
compose a new compound document with a new layout and new
interoperability of the extracted components. A huge variety
of objects ranging from traditional web documents with text
and images, to interactive tools, virtual labs, games and
community corners can be created and recreated with these
building blocks of ‘meme Lego’.
