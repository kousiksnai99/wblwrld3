<!--IMPORTANT NOTE: Only have one div (or other containing element) in the outer area as the one and only main container
    for all elements that might follow (or not)
    <div>[Other Content]</div>-->

<!--IMPORTANT NOTE 2: If you wish to include your own libraries and files, either from CDN or uploaded to the template
    do NOT include them in this HTML file (as one might think) but instead list them in the manifest
    file included in the Webble Dev Pack-->

<!--For AngularJS power the outer element must include 'ng-controller' which point to the controller function as it is
    named in the controllers file-->


<div id="timeline" ng-controller="timelineWebbleCtrl">
  <canvas id="theCanvas">
  </canvas>
</div>
