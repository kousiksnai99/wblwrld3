<!--IMPORTANT NOTE: Only have one div (or other containing element) in the outer area as the one and only main container
                    for all elements that might follow (or not)
                    <div>[Other Content]</div>-->

<!--IMPORTANT NOTE 2: If you wish to include your own libraries and files, either from CDN or uploaded to the template
                       do NOT include them in this HTML file (as one might think) but instead list them in the manifest
                       file included in the Webble Dev Pack-->

<!--For AngularJS power the outer element must include 'ng-controller' which point to the controller function as it is
named in the controllers file-->


<div id="haloMergeAppWrapper" class="haloMergeAppWrapper" ng-controller="haloMergeAppWebbleCtrl">
    <!--The content of your Webble is all up to you... do what needs to be done... go wild if needed-->
    <span id="haloMergeAppText" style="font-size: 48px;">{{displayText}}</span>
</div>
