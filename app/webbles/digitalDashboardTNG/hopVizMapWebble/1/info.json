 "description":"The Hands-on Portal Map visualization Webble shows various types of data on top of a map of the world.\n\nIt expects data to be provided by a Hands-on Portal data Webble, for example the hopFileDataWebble.\n\nTo start visualizing data, load some data (by for instance dropping a data file from the file system on the hopFileDataWebble) and then drag-and-drop the data field name you want to visualize from the list of data fields displayed by the data Webble and drop it on the area that shows the corresponding name when the you drag something over the Map Webble (e.g. drop longitude data on top of the field that says \"longitude\"). The map Webble needs at least longitude and latitude data to display something. You can also add end point longitudes and latitudes (to draw lines), data values (to draw heat map style visualizations) or sets of 3D data (shown in 2D on top of the map).\n\nClick and drag will select areas of the map.\nHolding Ctrl and clicking and dragging will create multiple selected areas (otherwise previously selections are replaced with the new selection).\nHolding Shift and clicking and dragging can be used to move around on the map.\n\nTo change various options, right-click on the Webble and select \"Properties\".",
