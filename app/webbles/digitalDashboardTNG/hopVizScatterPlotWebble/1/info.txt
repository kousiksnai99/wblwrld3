The Hands-on Portal Scatter Plot visualization Webble shows various types of data in a scatter plot.

It expects data to be provided by a Hands-on Portal data Webble, for example the hopFileDataWebble.

To start visualizing data, load some data (by for instance dropping a data file from the file system on the hopFileDataWebble) and then drag-and-drop the data field name you want to visualize from the list of data fields displayed by the data Webble and drop it on the area corresponding to the x-axis or the y-axis depending on where you want to see the data. The Scatter Plot Webble needs data for both the x-axis and the y-axis before it starts visualizing anything.

You can zoom the visualization with the "z" (zoom in) and "x" (zoom out) keys, or the "+" and "-" keys.
When zoomed, the view port can be panned around with either the arrow keys or with "w" (pan up), "s" (pan down), "a" (pan left), and "d" (pan right).

To change various options, right-click on the Webble and select "Properties".
