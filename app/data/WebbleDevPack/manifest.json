//REMOVE ALL COMMENTS FROM THIS FILE IF YOU WILL USE IT, OTHERWISE IT WILL NOT WORK
// If you use (own or 3rd party) files and libraries found from some online repsoitory, store the urls here under the
// libs item as a list (array) of strings. Include the whole path. Remember comma sign between each item if more than one.
// The third party file should NOT begin with 'use strict';, or it will not work, if it does, remove it
// 3rd party files that are stored in the Webble folder does not need to be added to the manifest (as in earlier versions) since they are found
// anyway in the file folder, UNLESS, the order of the files is of importance, then add those files to the manifest in order to instruct the Webble world
// system of the order in which to load files. Manifest files will always load first in the described order before any other Webble files.
// If this file is not used it can be discarded and thrown away and is not needed by the system.
